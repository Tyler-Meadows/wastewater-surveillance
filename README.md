This repository contains code for simulations and figures in "Epidemiological model can forecast COVID-19 outbreaks from wastewater-based surveillance in rural communities."

In order to run the code, you will need to install the ParticleFilter.jl package. You can do so by running
<code>PKG.add("https://github.com/Tyler-Meadows/ParticleFilter.jl")</code>. You can find some documentation on this package <a href = "https://tyler-meadows.github.io/ParticleFilter.jl/dev/"> here</a>.
